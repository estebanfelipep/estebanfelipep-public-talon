# My custom set of talon commands.

This repository is a collection of all commands I've came up with commands that I've found useful in my day to day work when working with Talon.

It also includes changes to default talon commands (for example, the alphabet).

I hope you find it useful.

## About Talon

Talon is a tool that allows me to use my computer **and code** without using my hands. Know more about talon in the [official page](https://talonvoice.com/) and [the community docs](https://talon.wiki/).
